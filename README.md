# Personal Website 
This is the source code for my personal static website. It is built using plain HTML/CSS/Javascript. Looking back at this website that I built in highchool by watching youtube videos... it taught me a lot about the basics of web development, and makes me appreciate the frameworks and libraries available to us even more. 

For example, I would have used a framework like React to generate components instead of having enormous amount of duplicate code across different pages. That could've saved me a LOT of time.

The website is hosted on Netlify and can be found at https://mingstone.netlify.app
